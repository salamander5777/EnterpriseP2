    Course: CNT 4714 Fall 2023
    Assignment title: Project 2 â€“ Multi-threaded programming in Java
    Date: October 8, 2023

    Class: Main
    Description: The primary initiator for this program. It reads in both theFleetFile.csv and theYardFile.csv files, and
                 assigns the read in values to some constructors (records) which are found in the Train class. Main also
                 initiates the ExecutorService with a defined thread pool of 30, and then executes a train to each
                 necessary thread (MAX 30). The ReentrantLocks are also initiated at this time. Each executed train
                 will be run together in the Train class.

    Class: Train
    Description: The backbone of this program. This class implements the functional interface Runnable which is necessary
                 for the run() function to operate as desired. This class also houses the records containing each Train,
                 the current train in use, and the overall start of the Yard (necessary for routing). This information
                 is used within run() to call functions such as findRoute (used to verify if a desired train route is
                 legitimate) and acquireSwitchLocks(), which is used to see if a train can lock in its route, so that it
                 can leave the yard. This method is rather brute force, with trains constantly vying for each available
                 lock that they need to leave the yard, with trains being forced to give up locks they have already claimed
                 if they come to a standstill in their attempt to move forward. Eventually, through this program, all
                 trains will leave the yard except for trains that contain an illegal route as they cannot move.
